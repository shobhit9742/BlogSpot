# BlogSpot
This repository serves as a central location for collaborative efforts to develop a visually appealing and functionally adept website compatible with the BlogSpot platform. Our team is committed to realizing the inherent elegance and refinement of BlogSpot within the digital sphere, prioritizing user-centric design principles and intuitive navigation for an optimal user experience.

## Objective
This project originated as a platform to apply the coding and problem-solving skillsets acquired during Masai School's curriculum. It fostered collaboration in the development of a fully functional website. Conceived and completed within a five-day timeframe during Masai's Construct Week, the project served as a collaborative instrument facilitating exploration, knowledge acquisition, and professional growth.

## Project Type
This project prioritizes front-end development, incorporating dynamic functionalities achieved through a simulated API created using JSON-server. The primary development tools leveraged include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap version 5.3 as a UI framework.

## Deployed App
The front-end application and the simulated back-end server have been independently deployed to Netlify and Render, respectively. Access to the deployed versions is provided below.
