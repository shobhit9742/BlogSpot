                <h1 class="ftext">Everyone has a story to tell.</h1>
                <p class="ftext2">Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share insightful
                    perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the world—without building a mailing list or a
                    following first. The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s
                    simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right audience for whatever you have to
                    say.</p>
                <p class="ftext2">We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us,
                    inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win,
                    we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful
                    conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging.</p>
                <h3 class="boldt">Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of the world through
                    the power of writing.</h3>
                <p class="ftext2">Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. Many are
                    professional writers, but just as many aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents,
                    amateur novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world. They write
                    about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what
                    they’ve learned that the rest of us might want to know too.</p>
                <p class="ftext2">Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medium members</span> who align with our mission. If
                    you’re new here, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">start exploring</span>. Dive deeper into
                    whatever matters to you. Find a post that helps you learn something new, or reconsider something
                    familiar—and then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">share your own story</span>.
